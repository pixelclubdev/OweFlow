## 4. Data Storage & Security

### 4.1 Local Storage
All your data (loans, contacts, reminders) is stored locally on your Android device in an encrypted SQLite database. Your data remains on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers.

### 4.2 Backup
Android's built-in backup feature may back up your app data if you have enabled automatic backups on your device. To control this:
1. Go to Settings > Google > Manage your Google Account > Data & Privacy
2. Scroll to "Android backup"
3. Turn off backup for OweFlow if you prefer your data not to be backed up

### 4.3 Security Measures
- Data is encrypted by Android's SQLite if your device has a lock screen
- All network connections use secure protocols
- Sensitive operations are protected with runtime permissions

---

## 5. Permissions We Request

### 5.1 POST_NOTIFICATIONS (Android 13+)
- **Purpose**: To send you reminder notifications about your loans
- **Optional**: You can deny this and still use the app, but reminders won't be shown

### 5.2 SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM (Android 12+)
- **Purpose**: To schedule precise reminder notifications at the time you set
- **Fallback**: If you deny this, the app will use inexact alarms instead

### 5.3 READ_CONTACTS
- **Purpose**: To suggest contact names and auto-populate phone/email when creating loans
- **Optional**: You can deny this and manually enter information

All permissions are optional unless noted otherwise, and you can revoke them at any time in your device settings.

## 6. Third-Party Services

### 6.1 Google AdMob
The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect:
- Advertising ID (AAID)
- General app usage information
- Non-personalized ads data

**Google's Privacy Policy**: https://policies.google.com/privacy

OweFlow does not share personal loan data with AdMob. Only standard Android advertising identifiers and general usage patterns are shared.

## 7. Data Retention & Deletion

### 7.1 Data You Control
You can delete any individual loan or contact at any time within the app by swiping or using the delete button.

You have the right to delete all your data at once. To do this:
1. Open OweFlow
2. Go to Settings (gear icon)
3. Tap "Delete All Data"
4. Confirm the action

This will permanently erase all loans, reminders, and associated contact information.

### 7.3 Uninstalling the App
Uninstalling the App will remove all data from your device (unless you have Android backup enabled, in which case you should follow the backup deletion steps above).
